## 🛠️ Development

### Folder Conventions

- **`scenes/`** — All `.tscn` scene files. Each major game object, level, or UI screen should have its own scene.
- **`scripts/`** — All `.gd` GDScript files. Scripts are typically attached to scene nodes or used as autoloads.
- **`assets/`** — Raw and imported assets (images, audio, fonts). Godot generates `.import` files here automatically.
- **`effects/`** — Visual effect resources such as shaders (`.gdshader`), particle materials, and environment resources.

### Coding Style

- Language: **GDScript**
- Follow [Godot's GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).
- Use `snake_case` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for class names and nodes.
